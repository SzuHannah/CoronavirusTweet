## Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with unprecedentedly extreme contagiousness, which is far beyond SARS or MERS. Its first outbreak was observed at Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, and it is a catastrophe on a global scale. While it is spreading all over the world, the speed or the pattern of how it is transmitted varies by country. There could be factors such as the governmentsâ€™ reactions that interfere with the spreading speed, but we want to delve into the social media perspective to investigate if it can predict the spread of COVID-19.
 
The initial thought is that social media is a platform where people discuss things they care about. Regarding COVID-19, there are so many online discussions every day. Thus, we are curious to examine if these discussions have anything to do with the spread of disease. In this application, tweets under the #coronavirus hashtag are used as the proxy for COVID-19 related social media discussions. As for indices of the disease spread, total confirm cases, total test cases, confirm cases per 100 tests, new cases, new deaths, and total deaths are included to let users explore. With the tweets data collected from Twitter API, and coronavirus data from John Hopkins and Our World in Data website, we found two ways to account for the variations in the COVID-19 case numbers: one is the topic clusters of the tweets which is shown in the "Tweet Wall" tab, and the other is the frequent words within tweets.
